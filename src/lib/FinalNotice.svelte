			<b>Notice</b>: 3rd October, 2022 seems to be the last day we need to update GetMyDeck as valve
			was able to catch up nearly all queues (EU 64GB a bit behind). So at the moment it takes only
			a couple of days from day of reservation until day of order and we are just before general
			availability. Read more in the final

			Stay tuned for the next updates. Additionally at the moment it is not sure that one can track Komodo
			region reservations the same way we did for the other regions. So not yet final if I can modify
			GetMyDeck to support Komodo region.
