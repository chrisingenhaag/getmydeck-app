    <b>TL;DR</b> This calculator shows how much progress valve was able to make delivering Steam
    Decks based on your personal reservation time and data other reddit users share in subreddit
    <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck">r/SteamDeck</a>.

    You just need to enter your region, version and reservation time to get your information about
    how far away you are from ordering your steam deck. Every monday and thursday at about 5pm GMT 
    you can just come back and see how data has changed (without a reddit account and talking to deckbot 
    every week). The url of the result page is a permalink you can use to check the progress.
