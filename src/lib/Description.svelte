  <h1 class="text-center">How long to get my Steam Deck?</h1>
  <p>Inspired from the reddit Steam Deck Order Email Megathreads <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/search?q=flair_name%3A%22MEGATHREAD%22&restrict_sr=1">(list of them here)</a> 
    I wanted to give an alternative way of getting actual information
    besides talking to the deckbot within the reddit. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway thanks to the great work of all guys behind the thread and their work on organizing this 
    and making the data available. 
    This site also relies on the data the people share in the reddit to 
    collect information which people are able to
    order their steam deck based on the reservation time, their region and their version.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here you just need to enter your data to get your information about how far 
    away you might be from ordering your steam deck. Every week 
    you can just come back and see if something has changed (without a reddit 
    account and talking to deckbot every week).
